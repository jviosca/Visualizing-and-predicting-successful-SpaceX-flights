## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

You will need to install Dash library to run the Dashboard app locally. Otherwise, there should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is my capstone project for the IBM Data Science Professional certificate, which I completed in August 2022. Here, we run a complete Data Science process from data collection, wrangling, visualization, modeling, evaluation and deployment with the aim to visualize and predict succesfull SpaceX launches.

Essentially, the question that we pursued in this project was: what factors do predict better a succesfull SpaceX rocket launch, meaning launch and subsequent landing? The features we analyzed included rocket characteristics and launch localization.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are several Jupyter notebooks, one Dash app python file and a pdf report. Files are numbered sequentially following the specific Data Science stage to which they correspond.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The final report can be found in the file named 'capstone-story-report.pdf'.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

The dataset was sourced by IBM and usage permissions should be enquiried directly to them. 
Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
